### Key Changes in Latest Version

- Modular JavaScript files for better code organization:
  - `camera.js`: Handles camera initialization and management
  - `recorder.js`: Manages video recording functionality
  - `ui.js`: Controls UI elements and interactions
  - `videoProcessor.js`: Handles video processing operations
  - `settings.js`: Centralizes configuration settings

## Getting Started üöÄ

### Prerequisites üìã

- Node.js (v14 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Camera Kit credentials from Snap

> üí° **New to Node.js?**
>
> 1. Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
> 2. After installation, open your terminal/command prompt
> 3. Verify installation by typing:
>    ```bash
>    node --version
>    npm --version
>    ```
>    Both commands should show version numbers

### Installation üíø

1. Clone the repository:

   > üí° **New to GitHub?**  
   > Choose one of these methods:
   >
   > **Option A: Using GitHub Desktop (Recommended for beginners)**
   >
   > - Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
   > - Click the green "Code" button above
   > - Click "Open with GitHub Desktop"
   > - Choose where to save it on your computer
   >
   > **Option B: Using Git command line**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gowaaa/camerakit-web-w-recordfeature.git
   cd camerakit-web-w-recordfeature
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

> üí° **Note**: For first-time installation, `npm ci` is recommended as it:
>
> - Ensures exact versions from package-lock.json
> - Is faster and more reliable
> - Provides consistent installations across all environments
>
> Only use `npm install` if you need to modify dependencies (add new ones or update existing ones).

3. Configure Camera Kit credentials:
   Create `.env` file in the root directory:

```
LENS_ID=__LENS_ID__
GROUP_ID=__GROUP_ID__
API_TOKEN=__API_TOKEN__
```

### Development üîß

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run serve
```

Webpack will start a development server with HTTPS enabled.
You'll see two URLs in the terminal:

- Local: `https://localhost:9000`
- Network: `https://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:9000` (for mobile devices)

To test on your mobile device, use the Network URL shown in your terminal.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Notes**:

- Your mobile device must be on the same WiFi network as your computer
- Accept the self-signed certificate warning in your browser when testing
- HTTPS is required for camera access on mobile devices

### Production Build üèóÔ∏è

Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

Output will be in a new `build` directory.

### Deployment on Vercel üöÄ

To deploy securely on Vercel:

1. Create a Vercel account at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)

   - Click "Sign Up"
   - Choose "Continue with GitHub"
   - Follow the authorization steps

2. Import your GitHub repository:

   - Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
   - Select your repository
   - Click "Import"

3. Add your Camera Kit credentials as environment variables:

   - In your project dashboard, go to "Settings" ‚Üí "Environment Variables"
   - Add these three variables exactly as shown:
     ```
     LENS_ID=your_actual_lens_id_here
     GROUP_ID=your_actual_group_id_here
     API_TOKEN=your_actual_api_token_here
     ```

4. Deploy your project:
   - Vercel will automatically detect and use the environment variables
   - Your credentials will be securely stored and used during build time

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**:

- Using environment variables on Vercel keeps your credentials secure
- Never commit actual credentials to your repository
- Use `.env.example` for reference (copy to `.env` and add your credentials for local development)
- Keep your `.env` file in `.gitignore`

## Browser Support üåê

- Chrome (latest) ‚úÖ
- Firefox (latest) ü¶ä
- Safari (iOS 14.5+) üì±
- Edge (latest) üåç

## Troubleshooting üîß

### Common Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **Build Errors**:

   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Check webpack configuration
   - Verify file paths in imports

2. **Camera Issues**:

   - Use HTTPS for camera access
   - Grant camera permissions
   - Check browser compatibility

3. **Recording Issues**:
   - Ensure sufficient device storage
   - Check MediaRecorder support
   - Verify permissions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note About Dependencies

This project requires specific dependency versions to function correctly. Please:

- Do not modify `package-lock.json`
- Use `npm ci` instead of `npm install` because:
  - It's faster and more reliable
  - It ensures exact versions from package-lock.json
  - It removes node_modules before installing
  - It won't update package.json or package-lock.json

The Camera Kit integration is sensitive to dependency versions. Modifying these may break the functionality.

Happy coding! üé•‚ú®
